**Liu8Can/Liu8Can** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on a mobile application project. I'm focused on improving its user interface design to make it more intuitive and user - friendly. I'm also working on optimizing the app's performance to reduce loading times.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python programming language. I'm exploring its various libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data analysis. I'm also delving into web development using Python frameworks such as Flask and Django.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open - source projects related to artificial intelligence. I believe collaborating with others can bring fresh perspectives and help me learn new techniques in AI, such as natural language processing and computer vision.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with advanced algorithms in machine learning. I find some concepts like neural network architectures and gradient descent optimization a bit challenging and would like to get some in - depth explanations and practical examples.
- 💬 Ask me about mobile app development, Python programming, or my experiences in learning new technologies.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can email me at liucan01234@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: Liucan.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once participated in a hackathon and my team managed to build a basic e - commerce app in just 48 hours.
